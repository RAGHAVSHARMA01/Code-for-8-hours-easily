 # Code-for-8-hours-easily
> There was a presentation by the presentor Abhinav kumar about how can the progtammers can work or code for 8hrs atleat without being tired.
> Along with this he also delievered some trick to release strees during the working hours.
> He was skilled enough to make his presentation on the reveal.js. He make the concept very clear that the audience was able to understand concept with ease.
> ### Starting with pesentation he told that what all should be changed in the methods to get the productivity at peak:-
>>   * Don't Start the work without deciding the target this means you are not suppose to follow the road aimlessly 
>>   * Try to achieve the outcomes before pick ups this means that untill and unless the initial work is pending, one doesn't need to go for the nwew work loads
> 
> The listener's were quite pleased with the don't and I suppouse they would try to implement this in there routine. Now, Kumar helped them with the methods of          implentation by giving some methods they can inmplement in the day to day life and in any kind of work they want to do in a tired free way.
> ### Implementation:-
>>   * System 69! -> This was the presonally best for me, this is basically a ``` Pomodoro Principle ```. Now what is this, the priniciple basically suggest the way to work for the long interval of times wihout being tired. The way given in this principle is, 25 to 5 which means work 25 minutes concentratorly and then 5 minutes of break repeate this for as long as you can. This can also varry in the was X minute work and y minute rest where x>y.
>>
>>> :warning: **If you are using mobile in break time**: Be very careful here, it could be dangerous!
>>  * TO-DO list -> This is the way by which a person can easily manage him and his work with the correct order or priority. This is also a approach to make thing easy-pesy and neat/clean
>>   * Scheduling Yourself -> This is little same as that of the TO-do list but this would manage your work with the help of time and time dependencies. This method suggest you to manage your work by assigning appropiate time to them.

> Estimating tommorow W.R.T the work you are doing today is a very good practice that one should continuously try to do. Along with the siggesting the presentor also made it clear that along with the work there must the sleep of ``` atleat 8 hours ```.
> 
> This was all about the presentation and the pesentator was good enough to make things clear and in a very interactive way. I myself have adopted the TO-DO list technique and in no time will aplly all the changes one by one.
